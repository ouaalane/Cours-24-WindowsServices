What Are Custom Windows Services?
Custom Windows services are services that you (or a developer) create to perform specific tasks. They are built using programming languages like C# and can run in the background to handle operations that the built-in services cannot accommodate.

Key Characteristics
Developed for specific business or operational needs.
Installed and configured by the user or administrator.
Can start automatically, manually, or on demand.
Run independently of user sessions, even when no user is logged in.
When to Create Custom Services
When you need continuous background processing, such as:
Monitoring directories for file changes.
Processing data on a schedule.
Automating recurring tasks (e.g., backups or database cleanups).
When existing built-in services cannot meet the unique requirements of your application.
When you want custom logging, monitoring, or task automation
