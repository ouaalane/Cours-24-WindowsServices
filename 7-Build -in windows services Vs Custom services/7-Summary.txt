Summary
Built-in Windows services handle core OS tasks like printing, updates, and security.
Custom Windows services are created to meet specific operational needs that built-in services cannot fulfill.
Choosing between built-in and custom services depends on the requirements of your application or system.
By understanding these differences, you can leverage built-in services where possible and develop custom services when needed.
