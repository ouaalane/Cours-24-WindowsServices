5. Configuring Services with Local or Network Accounts
Windows allows services to run under different built-in accounts, including LocalService and NetworkService. You can configure these in the Services Management Console (services.msc) or programmatically.

Using Services.msc:
Open Run (Win + R) and type services.msc.
Find the service you want to configure, right-click, and select Properties.
Go to the Log On tab.
Select the Local Service or Network Service account.
Restart the service for the changes to take effect.




Programmatic Configuration
You can configure the account for a custom Windows Service in C# during installation:

using System.ServiceProcess;
using System.Configuration.Install;

[RunInstaller(true)]
public class ProjectInstaller : Installer
{
    private ServiceProcessInstaller processInstaller;
    private ServiceInstaller serviceInstaller;

    public ProjectInstaller()
    {
        // Use NetworkService account
        processInstaller = new ServiceProcessInstaller
        {
            Account = ServiceAccount.NetworkService
        };

        // Define the service
        serviceInstaller = new ServiceInstaller
        {
            ServiceName = "MyCustomNetworkService",
            DisplayName = "My Custom Network Service",
            StartType = ServiceStartMode.Automatic
        };

        Installers.Add(processInstaller);
        Installers.Add(serviceInstaller);
    }
}
