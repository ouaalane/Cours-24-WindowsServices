4. When to Use Local Services vs. Network Services
Use Local Services When:
The service performs tasks that only involve local system resources. - Example: Audio playback, print job management, or file indexing.
You want to minimize security risks by running with minimal permissions.
No network connectivity is needed for the service to operate.
Example Scenario: A custom logging service that monitors files on the local system and writes logs to a local directory.

Use Network Services When:
The service needs access to network resources such as shared files, databases, or remote systems.
The service must interact with other computers on the network.
A balance of local and network permissions is required.
Example Scenario: A custom file sync service that transfers data between the local machine and a network file server.
