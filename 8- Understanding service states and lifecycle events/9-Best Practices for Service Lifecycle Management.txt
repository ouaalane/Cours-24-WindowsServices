Best Practices for Service Lifecycle Management
Monitor Service Status
Use tools like Task Manager, services.msc, or PowerShell to check service states.
Example
Get-Service -Name MyService



Configure Dependencies Ensure dependent services start in the correct order.
Graceful Shutdown Implement proper cleanup logic in the serviceâ€™s OnStop method to prevent errors.
Error Handling Use robust error handling in OnStart and OnStop to avoid prolonged pending states.
Logging Log lifecycle events (e.g., start, stop, pause) for better troubleshooting.
