Real-World Examples of Lifecycle Events
Example 1: Starting a Web Server
The web server is Installed.
When a system admin starts it, it enters the Start-Pending state.
Once initialization is complete, it moves to the Running state and begins handling HTTP requests.
Example 2: Stopping a Database Service
The database service is in the Running state.
The admin executes a stop command, and the service transitions to Stop-Pending to complete active transactions.
After cleanup, the service transitions to the Stopped state.
Example 3: Maintenance on a File Indexing Service
The service is Running.
It transitions to Paused during a system backup to prevent resource conflicts.
After the backup, it resumes to the Running state.
