MyFullServiceStateImplementation
This code represents a Windows Service implemented in C# named MyFullServiceStateImplementation. The service is designed to demonstrate the complete lifecycle management of a Windows Service, including core events such as starting, stopping, pausing, resuming, and shutting down.

The service logs its activities with timestamps to a configurable file directory, allowing for easy monitoring and debugging of the service's state transitions.

Overview of the Code
Namespace and References:

The code uses several namespaces to support essential functionality:
System.ServiceProcess: Provides the foundation for creating Windows Services.
System.IO: Enables file operations for logging events.
System.Configuration: Allows reading values like the log directory from a configuration file.
System.Diagnostics: Could be extended to provide event logging and diagnostics.
Main Features
1- Service Initialization:

Properties Enabled:
CanPauseAndContinue = true: The service supports pausing and resuming operations.
CanShutdown = true: The service is notified when the system shuts down.
Log Directory Configuration:
The service reads the log directory path from an external configuration file (App.config) for flexibility.
It validates the path and ensures the directory exists; otherwise, it creates the directory dynamically.
2- Event Logging:

The service logs all its state transitions (Start, Stop, Pause, Continue, Shutdown) to a file named ServiceStateLog.txt in the configured directory.
Each log entry includes a timestamp for tracking purposes.


Example Log Entry:

[2024-12-16 15:00:01] Service Started
[2024-12-16 15:05:30] Service Paused
[2024-12-16 15:10:15] Service Resumed
[2024-12-16 15:20:45] Service Stopped



3- Lifecycle Event Handlers: The service overrides key lifecycle events provided by the ServiceBase class:

OnStart: Triggered when the service starts.
protected override void OnStart(string[] args)
{
    LogServiceEvent("Service Started");
}


OnStop: Triggered when the service stops.
protected override void OnStop()
{
    LogServiceEvent("Service Stopped");
}


OnPause: Triggered when the service is paused.
protected override void OnPause()
{
    LogServiceEvent("Service Paused");
}


OnContinue: Triggered when the service resumes after being paused.
protected override void OnContinue()
{
    LogServiceEvent("Service Resumed");
}


OnShutdown: Triggered when the system is shutting down.
protected override void OnShutdown()
{
    LogServiceEvent("Service Shutdown due to system shutdown");
}
Code Highlights
1- Logging Functionality:

The LogServiceEvent method is used throughout the code to write timestamped messages to the log file:
private void LogServiceEvent(string message)
{
    string logMessage = $"[{DateTime.Now:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss}] {message}\n";
    File.AppendAllText(logFilePath, logMessage);
}


2- Configuration for Flexibility:

The log directory path is fetched dynamically from the App.config file:
csharp
Copy code
logDirectory = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["LogDirectory"];
If the directory does not exist, it is created at runtime:
csharp
Copy code
if (!Directory.Exists(logDirectory))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(logDirectory);
}
3- State Management:

The service handles all possible states (Start, Stop, Pause, Resume, Shutdown), making it robust for real-world scenarios.
How the Service Works
Initialization:
When the service starts, it checks the log directory configuration and initializes the logging system.
Lifecycle Events:
Each lifecycle event (OnStart, OnStop, OnPause, etc.) is logged to the file, allowing you to track when and how the service changes its state.
Shutdown Support:
If the system shuts down, the OnShutdown method ensures that the service logs this event properly before termination.


Installation Instructions to run and manage the service:
Download Source Code.
Open the Solution.
Build the project in debug mode.
To bin directory and copy the file under debug folder.
Create Directory "c:\MyServices\"
Place the files under "c:\MyServices\"
Run Command Prompt with admin previlages.
execute these commands :
cd c:\MyServices\
sc create MyFullServiceStateImplementation binPath= "C:\MyServices\MyFullSelrviceStateImpementation.exe"
The service should be installed successfully, run services.msc
Test the service, Start, Stop, Pause, Resume , then go to check the log file under c:\ServiceLogs
Done.
