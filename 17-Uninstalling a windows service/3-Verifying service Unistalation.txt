3. Verifying Service Uninstallation
After uninstalling the service, verify that it has been removed successfully:

1- Open Services Management Console (services.msc):

Check that the service no longer appears in the list.
2- Use the sc query command to confirm:

sc query YourServiceName



3- If the service is deleted, the query will return:

[SC] EnumQueryServicesStatus: OpenService FAILED 1060:
The specified service does not exist as an installed service.



4- Check the Windows Registry:

Ensure there is no entry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services.
