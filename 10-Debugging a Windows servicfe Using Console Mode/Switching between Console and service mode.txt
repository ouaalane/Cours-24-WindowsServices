  Switching Between Console and Service Modes
Switching Between Console and Service Modes
A. Enabling Console Mode
By default, a Windows Service project suppresses the console window because itâ€™s configured as a Windows Application. To enable the console window:

Open Project Properties in Visual Studio.
Go to the Application tab.
Change the Output Type to Console Application.
Rebuild the project.




B. Running as a Windows Service
After debugging, revert the Output Type to Windows Application and rebuild the project. Deploy the service using standard installation steps (e.g., InstallUtil)
