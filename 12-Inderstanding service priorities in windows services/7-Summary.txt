Summary
Service priorities determine how much CPU time and resources a service receives.
Windows assigns default priorities but allows them to be adjusted using Task Manager, sc, PowerShell, or programmatically.
Proper use of service priorities ensures that critical tasks run efficiently without disrupting system performance.
