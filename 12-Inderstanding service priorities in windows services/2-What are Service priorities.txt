1. What Are Service Priorities?
Service priorities determine the order of execution and the resource allocation for Windows Services. Each service runs as a process or thread, and Windows assigns it a priority level to control how much CPU time it receives relative to other processes.

Why Are Service Priorities Important?
Ensures critical system services, such as the Windows Update Service or Security Services, receive sufficient CPU and memory.
Allows administrators to optimize performance for specific services that are resource-intensive.
Prevents background services from interfering with real-time processes or user applications.
