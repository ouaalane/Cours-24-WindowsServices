3. Tools for Monitoring and Managing Service Priorities
You can view and manage the priorities of running services using various tools:

A. Task Manager
Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc).
Go to the Details tab to view process priority levels.
Right-click a process (e.g., a custom service) → Set Priority → Select a priority class.
Note: Task Manager changes the priority temporarily until the process restarts.
B. Command Prompt (using wmic)
Use the wmic command to view or adjust process priorities.
View the Priority of a Process:
wmic process where name="MyService.exe" get Name, Priority

Change the Priority:
wmic process where name="MyService.exe" CALL setpriority 128

Priority Codes:
256: Real-Time
128: High
32768: Above Normal
32: Normal
16384: Below Normal
64: Idle
C. PowerShell
Use PowerShell to retrieve and modify service process priorities:

Get Process Priority:
Get-Process -Name MyService | Select-Object Name, Id, PriorityClass

Set Process Priority:
(Get-Process -Name MyService).PriorityClass = "High"



The valid PriorityClass values for processes in Windows are as follows:

Idle
Lowest priority for CPU scheduling.
Used for processes that run only when the system is idle.
BelowNormal
Lower than normal priority.
Used for processes that should run with less impact on the system than normal processes.
Normal
Default priority class.
Used for most applications.
AboveNormal
Higher priority than normal.
Used for processes that need more CPU time but aren't critical.
High
High-priority class.
Used for time-critical tasks that require immediate execution.
Be cautious: this can affect other processes' performance.
RealTime
Highest possible priority.
Used for processes that need to respond immediately to real-time events.
Be extremely cautious: this can starve other processes, including essential system processes.
