4. Scenarios for Adjusting Service Priorities
Ensuring Critical Services Are Responsive:
Example: An antivirus scanning service may require High priority to ensure security tasks are performed quickly.
Optimizing Background Tasks:
Example: A file indexing service can be set to Below Normal or Idle to avoid interfering with foreground applications.
Managing Resource-Intensive Services:
Example: A custom data-processing service may need Above Normal priority during peak times.
Preventing Starvation:
Example: Setting critical monitoring services to Normal ensures they run consistently without starving lower-priority tasks.
