2. How Service Dependencies Work
Key Principles:
A service cannot start unless all its dependencies are already running.
If a dependency service stops, the dependent service will also stop (depending on the configuration).
Dependencies are managed by the Service Control Manager (SCM).
Example of Service Dependencies:
Service A depends on Service B.
When you attempt to start Service A, Windows ensures Service B starts first.
