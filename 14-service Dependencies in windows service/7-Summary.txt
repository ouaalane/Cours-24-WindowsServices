Summary
Service dependencies ensure that services start and stop in the correct order, avoiding runtime failures.
Tools like services.msc, sc, and PowerShell help you configure and troubleshoot dependencies.
Dependencies can be defined programmatically using the ServicesDependedOn property in C#.
Proper dependency management improves service reliability and system stability.
