1. What Are Service Dependencies?
A service dependency is a relationship where one service (dependent service) relies on another service (dependency) to start and run properly. The dependent service cannot start until its dependencies have started.

Why Are Service Dependencies Important?
Ensures the correct startup order of services.
Prevents errors or failures if a required service is not running.
Helps manage complex systems with interdependent services.
Improves reliability and stability for services requiring prerequisites.
