Summary
The Services Control Manager (SCM) manages the lifecycle of all Windows services, including starting, stopping, and monitoring their states.
Tools like services.msc, the sc command, and PowerShell provide different ways to interact with the SCM.
The SCM handles dependencies and can automatically recover services in case of failures.
A strong understanding of SCM enables efficient management of both built-in and custom services.
