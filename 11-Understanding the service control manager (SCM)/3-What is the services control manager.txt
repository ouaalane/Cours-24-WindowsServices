The Services Control Manager (SCM) is a system process in Windows that manages all Windows services. It acts as an intermediary between the operating system and services, allowing administrators and the system to:

Start and stop services.
Pause and resume services.
Handle service dependencies.
Monitor the state of services (e.g., Running, Stopped, Paused).
Log service failures and trigger recovery actions.
Key Characteristics
SCM starts as part of the Windows boot process.
It maintains the state and configuration of services.
It allows services to run in the background without user intervention.
