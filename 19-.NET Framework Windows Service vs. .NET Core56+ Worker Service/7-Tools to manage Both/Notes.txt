Debugging in Console Mode
For .NET Core, run the service as a console application during development:

MyService.exe

Observe logs and interact directly in the console, a feature not natively available in .NET Framework.

4. Special Notes for .NET Core
Configuration via appsettings.json:
.NET Core services often use JSON-based configurations, making them easier to manage and extend.
Cross-Platform Deployment:
If deploying to Linux, youâ€™ll use tools like systemctl to manage services instead of Windows-specific tools like sc.
Conclusion
While most interacting tools like sc, PowerShell, and services.msc remain the same, .NET Core introduces modern deployment methods, debugging options, and configuration management that simplify and enhance the development and interaction experience. ðŸš€
