.NET Framework Windows Services are powerful for Windows environments but are limited to that platform.
Worker Services in .NET Core are more modern, lightweight, and support cross-platform deployments.
Choose Worker Services for new development and cross-platform requirements, while .NET Framework services may still be useful for legacy applications.
