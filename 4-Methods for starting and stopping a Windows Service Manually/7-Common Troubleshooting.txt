Common Troubleshooting
Service Does Not Start or Stop:
Check logs for errors: Look in the Event Viewer (Win + S, search for 'Event Viewer`).
Ensure dependencies are running: Use the Dependencies tab in services.msc.
Access Denied:
Run Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator.
Service Stuck in STOP_PENDING or START_PENDING State:
Check the service logic in OnStart or OnStop.
Use taskkill to forcefully terminate the service:
taskkill /f /pid <ProcessID>


Note: you can get the process ID PID from task manager.

sc query state= all
