Dependent Services
Description: These services depend on other services to function. They cannot start or run unless their dependencies are active.
Purpose: Ensure coordinated functionality by relying on prerequisite services.
Examples:
DHCP Client (Dhcp): Requires the Network Store Interface Service to manage network configurations.
SQL Server Agent (SQLSERVERAGENT): Depends on the SQL Server service to execute database-related jobs.
